	     <p><b>Mahendra Singh Dhoni</b> or MS Dhoni is one of the best finishers in the game of cricket and one of the best captains for the Indian national team. Dhoni took over the ODI captaincy from Rahul Dravid in 2007 after debuting in 2004. He holds multiple captaincy records such as most wins for an Indian captain in Tests and ODIs, and most back-to-back wins by an Indian captain in ODIs. His biggest triumphs as captain have been the 2007 World T20, 2010 Asia Cup, 2011 World Cup and 2013 Champions Trophy. His heroic inning of 91 from 79 balls in the 2011 World Cup is one of his biggest highlights as a batsman and one which rose him to fame for his ability to stay cool under pressure thus earning him the moniker of 'Captain Cool'. In the IPL, he's led Chennai Super Kings (CSK) to titles in 2010 and 2011. Dhoni retired from Test cricket in late 2014 to hand Virat Kohli the baton. He is known for his love for motorcycles and away from cricket, co-owns the Indian Super League (ISL) side Chennaiyin FC. In 2016, a movie was made on his life called "MS Dhoni: The Untold Story" in a perfect adaption of someone who has lived a rags-to-riches tale from being a TTE in 2001.</p>

		<p><b>Rajinikanth's</b> acting career commenced with a brief phase of portraying antagonistic characters in Tamil films. The Suresh Krissna-directed Baashha (1995) in which Rajinikanth played a crime boss, was a major commercial success in his career and earned him a 'god-like' status in Tamil Nadu.Sivaji (2007) was the third Indian film to enter the 100 Crore Club.He played dual roles, as a scientist and an andro-humanoid robot, in the science fiction film Enthiran (2010) and its sequel 2.0 (2018), both being India's most expensive production at the time of their release, and among the one of highest-grossing Indian films of all time.Rajinikanth is widely regarded as one of the popular actors in the history of Indian cinema. His popularity has been attributed to his uniquely styled dialogues and idiosyncrasies in films, as well as his political statements and philanthropy. A philanthropist, he undertook a day-long fast in 2002 to protest the Government of Karnataka's decision to not release Kaveri River water into Tamil Nadu, and donated â‚¹10 million (US$140,000) toward a plan to interlink Indian rivers. Rajinikanth is the only Indian actor to be featured in the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) syllabus, in a lesson titled From Bus Conductor to Superstar..</p>
